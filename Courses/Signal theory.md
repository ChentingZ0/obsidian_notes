Basic concepts:
- ACF(auto correlation function): Â the correlation of a signal with a delayed copy of itself. It measures and plots the average correlation between data points in time series
- Power spectral: 

- Linear estimator, normal equations, MMSE

- Wiener filter

- Stationary process: the ACF of the signal only depend on the time difference, and independent of the absolute time instance.

- ARMA model
Short for Auto-regression, Moving average
Forecasting time-series data, rely on past data to make estimates about current and future value.
