2. Explain briefly the similarities and differences of document-based and column oriented databases. What is the difference between storing data in row model and column model? When is better to use the column model? (5 points)
**Concepts**: databases
**Answer**:
- *Similarities*: 
Both are NoSQL Databases, which means they are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.

Both allow for flexible schemas, where the structure of the data can vary within the same collection or table.

Both are designed for horizontal scalability, allowing to add more servers to handle increasing data loads.

- *Difference*:
Document-based: store data in documents, in formats like JSON. Column-oriented: store data in columns rather than rows.

*When to use column model*:
Perform analytical queries that involve aggregations, filtering, and calculations on large datasets. Better for row model since it is faster when quering.

You are dealing with data warehousing, business intelligence, and data analytics use cases where performance and storage efficiency are critical.(Apache Cassandra, HBase, or Google Bigtable)

3. Assume we want to implement a MapReduce code to multiply a one-dimensional matrix with a two-dimensional matrix. Briefly explain what map and reduce functions should do. (5 points) 
	Reminder. The matrix product of matrices A and B is a third matrix C, where C = AB. If A is of shape m × n and B is of shape n × p, then C is of shape m × p, such that:
