Multivariate statistical method employed to understand the underlying structure of a dataset.

It aims to identify latent variables, often called factors, that explain the correlations among observed variables. It is a method for investigating whether a number of variables of interest are linearly related to a smaller number of unobservable factors.

By doing so, it helps researchers reduce the dimensions of their data and identify meaningful patterns. It transforms numerous correlated variables into a smaller set of uncorrelated factors, making it easier to interpret the relationships within the data.
