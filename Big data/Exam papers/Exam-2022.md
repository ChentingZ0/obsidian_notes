1. (2 points) Assume you are designing a NoSQL database to store students’ profiles. Each student has a unique ID and some extra information, which are not fixed among students. What data model do you use in your database? Moreover, assume you want to use consistent hashing to store students’ profiles across computers. Explain how you can use consistent hashing to spread data in your network.

**Concepts:**
[[Databases]]
Consistent hashing: [[Cassandra]]

**Answer:**
Unique ID, extra different information for each student -> Varying attributes for each student.
A wide-column store(Cassandra) or a document-oriented database(MongoDB)

Data partition:
Each student profile (with a unique ID) can be considered as a data point.
Apply a consistent hashing algorithm to map each student's ID to a position on a virtual ring or continuum.
`partition = hash(data) mode size(id space)`
For fault tolerance, you can replicate data on multiple nodes. Each student's data can be stored on multiple nodes, not just one.
