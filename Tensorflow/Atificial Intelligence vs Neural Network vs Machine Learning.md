**AI:** The effort to automate intellectual tasks normally  performed by humans. Can computer think? Before that, it just some pre-defined rules.

**ML**: Machine Learning is part of AI. Unlike giving an algorithm and let it follow and give us the solution. ML gives the data and the result and asks the machine to figure out the rule for us.

**Neural Networks**: A form of machine learning that uses a layered representation of data. Deep learning, means it has multiple layers. layer representation. 


### Different Types of Machine Learning

We have Features and label, the programming supervise the output and tweak to get the optimal result.

- **Supervised Learning**

- **Unsupervised Learning**
We have the features. We don't have the labels. We get the unsupervised model to figure out for us.
eg. K means clustering


- **Reinforcement Learning**
We have agent, reward, flag. 
Goal: Find a path to maximize the reward
